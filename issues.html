        <p>The Issues represent historical-cultural ages, allowing to get in touch with the evolution of poetry through time. Three issues are proposed at the moment, Ancient Era, XIX century and XXI century (nowadays), but more are coming soon! For each cultural era, you will find one poetess, with three of her poems.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">The Ancient Era</h3>
        <p><b>Sappho</b> (c. 630 – c. 570 BC) was an Archaic Greek poet from Eresos or Mytilene on the island of Lesbos. Sappho is known for her lyric poetry, written to be sung while accompanied by music. <br><br>In ancient times, Sappho was widely regarded as one of the greatest lyric poets and was given names such as the "<i>Tenth Muse</i>" and "<i>The Poetess</i>". Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has mostly survived in fragmentary form; only the <i>Ode to Aphrodite</i> is certainly complete. Sappho was a prolific poet, probably composing around 10,000 lines. Her poetry was well-known and greatly admired through much of antiquity, and she was among the canon of Nine Lyric Poets most highly esteemed by scholars of <a href="https://www.hellenistic-alexandria.com/">Hellenistic Alexandria</a>. <br><br>Beyond her poetry, she is well known as a symbol of love and desire between women, with the English words <i>sapphic</i> and <i>lesbian</i> deriving from her name and that of her home island respectively.</p>

        <p><b>Emily Elizabeth Dickinson</b> (December 10, 1830 – May 15, 1886) was an American poet. Little-known during her life, she has since been regarded as one of the most important figures in American poetry. <br><br>Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts. After studying at the <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/">Amherst Academy</a> for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/">Mount Holyoke</a> Female Seminary before returning to her family's home in Amherst. While Dickinson was a prolific writer, her only publications during her lifetime were 10 of her nearly 1,800 poems, and one letter.<br><br>Her poems were unique for her era; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends, and also explore aesthetics, society, nature, and spirituality.<br><br>Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd. In 1998, <i>The <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a></i></i> reported on an infrared technology study revealing that much of Dickinson's work had been deliberately censored to exclude the name "Susan". At least eleven of Dickinson's poems were dedicated to her sister-in-law Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson, though all the dedications were obliterated, presumably by Todd. These edits work to censor the nature of Emily and Susan's relationship, which many scholars have interpreted as romantic.</p>

        <p><b>Rupi Kaur</b> (born 4 October 1992) is a Canadian poet, illustrator, photographer, and author. Born in Punjab, India, Kaur emigrated to Canada at a young age with her family. She began performing poetry in 2009 and rose to fame on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rupikaur_/">Instagram</a>.<br><br>In March 2015, as a part of her university photography project, Kaur posted a series of photographs to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> depicting herself with menstrual blood stains on her clothing and bedsheets. Instagram removed the image, in response to which Kaur wrote a viral critique of the company's actions. As a result of the incident, Kaur's poetry gained more traction and her initially self-published debut collection, <i><a href="https://rupikaur.com/pages/milk-and-honey">Milk and Honey</a></i> (2014), was reprinted to widespread commercial success.<br><br>The success of <i>Milk and Honey</i> proved worrisome for Kaur as she struggled throughout the creation of the follow-up, <i><a href="https://rupikaur.com/pages/the-sun-and-her-flowers-books">The Sun and Her Flowers</a></i> (2017). She experienced burnout after the release, but soon recovered. She wanted to feel less pressure for commercial success, which influenced her third collection, <i><a href="https://rupikaur.com/pages/home-body-books">Home Body</a></i> (2020) – a partial response to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>Since its release in 2014, her collection <i>Milk and Honey</i> has sold over 2.5 million copies in 25 languages, spending 77 weeks on the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a></i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/">Best-Seller List</a>. Kaur has been praised for influencing the modern literary scene. She has been included on congratulatory year-end lists by the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a> and <a href="https://www.elle.com/">Elle</a>; <a href="https://newrepublic.com/">The New Republic</a> controversially called her the "<i>Writer of the Decade</i>". <br><br> Her last book, <i><a href="https://rupikaur.com/pages/healing-through-words">Healing Through Words</a></i>, is a collection of guided writing exercises encouraging to explore themes of trauma, loss, heartache, love, healing, and celebration of the self.</p>
